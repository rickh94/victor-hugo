# Declaration

> When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands 
> which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station
> to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
> requires that they should declare the causes which Imple them to the separation."

 -- *Thomas Jefferson*
